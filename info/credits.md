# Credits
Shen Yu is an original work, but it couldn't have been completed with the help of these people:

- Marcel Vanthoor, author of the chess engine [rustic](https://github.com/mvanthoor/rustic). As an inexperienced rust programmer, the clear examples in your code are invaluable.
- H.G.M, the veritable sensei of chess programming, who has been guiding new chess programmers on talkchess for years.
- Christopher Dean, author of [Blunder](https://github.com/algerbrex/blunder). Whenever I'm stuck on something, I always look to your code, knowing I'll find a clean and didactic implementation. Thanks for answering my questions on StackExchange at the beginning.
- Thomas Jahn, author of [Leorik](https://github.com/lithander/Leorik). Your devlog on Talkchess has provided me with a gold mine of useful ideas to try, and a useful measuring stick to make sure that I'm not making some terrible mistake.
- Peter Ellis Jones, whose [blog](https://peterellisjones.com/posts/generating-legal-chess-moves-efficiently/) helped me develop my legal move generator.
- All of the people on talkchess for answering my dumb questions. They seem so obvious now, but they weren't when I asked them.
- My friend Mirai, who helped me cross-compile my engine when I couldn't figure out how to.

And, of course, thanks to the [Chess Programming wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page). I don't want to imagine how long it would have taken to write this engine without you.
